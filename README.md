# Sync City

**A simple, modern platform to help people sync up for activities and meetups without the hassle of planning.**

Sync City is a Next.js-based web application designed to make organizing group activities effortless.
Users choose an activity, set their availability, get matched with others who share the same interests, and simply *show up*.
No endless chats, no coordination headaches — just seamless social syncing.

## Features

* **Activity-based matching** – Users select what they want to do (e.g., running, games, walks, etc.).
* **Smart availability sync** – Matches users based on overlapping free times.
* **Group formation** – Groups are generated automatically when enough compatible users exist.
* **Clean UI + responsive design** using **Tailwind CSS**.
* **Real-time interactions** (via Liveblocks configuration in the repo).
* **Optimized for Vercel deployment** through Next.js.
